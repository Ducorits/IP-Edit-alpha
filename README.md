# IP-Edit-alpha
Early version of a minecraft datapack, intended to make creating and editing portals from Immersive Portals easier.


=== How to use ===

First up you will need the edit wand.
To obtain the wand, throw an "eye of ender" and a "warped fungus on a stick" together on the ground, wait a bit and BAM! you got a wand.

To begin using the wand, right click on a portal while holding it, some particles should appear in the middle of the portal to indicate it is selected.
To select multiple portals, crouch while selecting.

To open the menu, drop the wand when it is in your main hand.
Navigate the menu by clicking the text.
Select wand mode refers to the offhand use of the item.
Offhand can have different functions (modes) assigned to it.

NOTE: Dimension menu is still buggy and unrefined (but it works), not all buttons have a function. I will make an uninstall option later to clean up everything if you so desire.
